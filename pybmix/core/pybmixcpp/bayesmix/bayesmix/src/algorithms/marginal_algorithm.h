//! Template class for a marginal sampler deriving from `BaseAlgorithm`.

//! This template class implements a generic Gibbs sampling marginal algorithm
//! as the child of the `BaseAlgorithm` class.
//! A mixture model sampled from a Marginal Algorithm can be expressed as
//!   x_i | c_i, phi_1, ..., phi_k ~ f(x_i|phi_(c_i))    (data likelihood);
//!               phi_1, ... phi_k ~ G                   (unique values);
//!                   c_1, ... c_n ~ EPPF(c_1, ... c_n)  (cluster allocations);
//! where f(x | phi_j) is a density for each value of phi_j and the c_i take
//! values in {1, ..., k}.
//! Depending on the actual implementation, the algorithm might require
//! the kernel/likelihood f(x | phi) and G(phi) to be conjugagte or not.
//! In the former case, a `ConjugateHierarchy` must be specified.
//! In this library, each phi_j is represented as an `Hierarchy` object (which
//! inherits from `AbstractHierarchy`), that also holds the information related
//! to the base measure `G` is (see `AbstractHierarchy`). The EPPF is instead
//! represented as a `Mixing` object, which inherits from `AbstractMixing`.
//!
//! The state of a marginal algorithm only consists of allocations and unique
//! values. In this class of algorithms, the local lpdf estimate for a single
//! iteration is a weighted average of likelihood values corresponding to each
//! component (i.e. cluster), with the weights being based on its cardinality,
//! and of the marginal component, which depends on the specific algorithm.
