//! Template class for a conditional sampler deriving from `BaseAlgorithm`.

//! This template class implements a generic Gibbs sampling conditional
//! algorithm as the child of the `BaseAlgorithm` class.
//! A mixture model sampled from a conditional algorithm can be expressed as
//!   x_i | c_i, phi_1, ..., phi_k ~ f(x_i|phi_(c_i))    (data likelihood);
//!               phi_1, ... phi_k ~ G                   (unique values);
//!   c_1, ... c_n | w_1, ..., w_k ~ Cat(w_1, ... w_k)   (cluster allocations);
//!                  w_1, ..., w_k ~ p(w_1, ..., w_k)    (mixture weights)
//! where f(x | phi_j) is a density for each value of phi_j, the c_i take
//! values in {1, ..., k} and w_1, ..., w_k are nonnegative weights whose sum
//! is a.s. 1, i.e. p(w_1, ... w_k) is a probability distribution on the k-1
//! dimensional unit simplex).
//! In this library, each phi_j is represented as an `Hierarchy` object (which
//! inherits from `AbstractHierarchy`), that also holds the information related
//! to the base measure `G` is (see `AbstractHierarchy`).
//! The weights (w_1, ..., w_k) are represented as a `Mixing` object, which
//! inherits from `AbstractMixing`.

//! The state of a conditional algorithm consists of the unique values, the
//! cluster allocations and the mixture weights. The former two are stored in
//! this class, while the weights are stored in the `Mixing` object.
