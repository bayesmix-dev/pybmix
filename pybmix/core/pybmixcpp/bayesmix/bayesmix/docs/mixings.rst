Mixings
=======

In the algorithms of the library, we store a single ``Mixing`` object that represents a prior for the mixing weights for the mixture models and the induced exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF).
There are two types of ``Mixing``: marginal and conditional, each of which can only be used with the matching type of ``Algorithm``.
For both of these types, certain API functions are required.


--------------
Code structure
--------------

We employ a Curiously Recurring Template Pattern coupled with an abstract interface, similarly to the ``Hierarchy`` class (see :ref:`here <hierarchies-crtp>`).
The code thus composes of: a virtual class defining the API, a template base class that is the base for the CRTP and derived child classes that fully specialize the template arguments.
The class ``AbstractMixing`` defines the API, i.e. all the methods that need to be called from outside of a ``Mixing`` class.
A template class ``BaseMixing`` inherits from ``AbstractMixing`` and implements some of the necessary virtual methods, which need not be implemented by the child classes.
