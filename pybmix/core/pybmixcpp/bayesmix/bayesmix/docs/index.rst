   :alt: Documentation Status

``bayesmix`` is a C++ library for running MCMC simulations in Bayesian mixture models.
It uses the ``Eigen`` library for vector-matrix manipulation and linear algebra, and ``protobuf`` (Protocol Buffers) for communication and storage of structured data.



Submodules
==========

There are currently three submodules to the ``bayesmix`` library, represented by three classes of objects:

- ``Algorithms``
- ``Hierarchies``
- ``Mixings``

Further, we employ Protocol buffers for several purposes, including serialization. The list of all protos with their docs is available in the ``protos`` link below.
