To implement a hierarchy in Python
----------------------------------

Create a ``.py`` file implementing all the necessary methods of the
hierarchy, you can find examples in ``docs/examples``. Specifically:

-  to implement a non-conjugate hierarchy you need to define the
   methods:
   ``is_conjugate, like_lpdf, initialize_state, initialize_hypers,   update_hypers, draw, update_summary_statistics, sample_full_cond``.
   Please refer to the ``LapNIG_Hierarchy.py`` example for details.
-  to implement a conjugate hierarchy you need to define the methods:
   ``is_conjugate, like_lpdf, marg_lpdf, initialize_state,   initialize_hypers, update_hypers, draw, compute_posterior_hypers,   update_summary_statistics``.
   Please refer to the ``NNIG_Hierarchy_NGG.py`` examples for details.

To implement a mixing in Python
-------------------------------

Create a ``.py`` file in ``pybmix/docs/examples`` implementing all the
necessary methods of the mixing, you can find an example in
``docs/examples``. Specifically: - to implement a non-conditional mixing
you need to define the methods:
``is_conditional, update_state, initialize_state, mass_existing_cluster, mass_new_cluster``.
Please refer to the ``DP_mixing.py`` example for details. - to implement
a conditional mixing you need to define the methods:
``is_conditional, update_state, initialize_state, mixing_weights``.

For working examples please refer to ``test_run.py`` and
``estimate_pyhier_desnity.ipynb``.
